# MYDAILYWORK
This repository contains three machine learning projects I completed as part of my internship with MyDailyWork.

Project 1: Iris Classification

The Iris Classification project aims to develop a model that can accurately classify Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. This project involves exploring data visualization techniques to understand the distribution of features, handling missing values, and applying machine learning algorithms to classify Iris species.

Project 2: Titanic Survival Prediction

The Titanic Survival Prediction project involves developing a model that can predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on their characteristics, such as age, sex, and class. This project requires handling missing values, performing feature engineering to extract relevant information, and applying machine learning algorithms to predict passenger survival.

Project 3: Credit Card Fraud Detection

The Credit Card Fraud Detection project focuses on developing a model that can detect fraudulent credit card transactions. This project involves handling class imbalance to ensure accurate detection of fraudulent transactions, exploring data visualization techniques to understand transaction patterns, and applying machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions.

Technologies Used

Throughout these projects, I utilized various technologies, including Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and Imbalanced-learn. These tools enabled me to efficiently preprocess data, visualize results, and apply machine learning algorithms to solve complex problems.
